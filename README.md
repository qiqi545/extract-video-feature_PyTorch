# Extract Video Feature (PyTorch)
Pytorch implementation of extracting frame-level features of video by a 2D CNN(ResNet-18). This project is made by Shengeng Tang.
Hefei University of Technology, Ph.D candidate.

In this project, we (1) first split the video into frames, (2) then extract the frame-level features, and (3) finally combine the frame-level features into clip-level features for alignment and fusion with other features.

# Requirements
